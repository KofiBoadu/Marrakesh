# Travel Torch

## Introduction

**Travel Torch** is a specialized CRM designed to streamline and enhance the management and analytical processes for small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the tourism industry. This application serves as a centralized platform, offering real-time insights into sales and customer growth.

### Key Features

- **Customer Management:** An interface displaying all current year's booked travelers or clients. Users can add and categorize customers based on the type of service booked, such as group trips, private, family, or corporate trips.
- **Revenue Tracking:** Each customer profile includes a lifetime revenue generator, tracking the total expenditure of the customer with the company. This feature aids in identifying and incentivizing recurring customers to enhance their lifetime value.

The primary purpose of Travel Torch is to provide tour companies with an easy-to-use tool for visualizing and analyzing annual growth, thereby improving their business strategies and customer relationships.

## Target Audience

Travel Torch is tailored for SMEs within the tourism industry, aiming to provide a solution that meets the specific needs and challenges of this sector.

## Motivation

The inception of Travel Torch arose from the firsthand experience of running a travel company. Existing CRM solutions offered generalized features that didn't cater specifically to the unique requirements of the tourism sector. The need for a system that focuses on industry-specific metrics and simplifies various repetitive tasks in our business model led to the development of this project.

This CRM addresses several challenges:
- Providing real-time updates on gross revenue.
- Tracking the number of booked customers within a calendar year.
- Offering comprehensive customer profiles for better retention strategies.

The inspiration behind Travel Torch is to solve an internal problem by creating a tool that is finely tuned to our business model and industry needs.
